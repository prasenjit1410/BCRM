First try to understand the requirement, where this can fit appropriately

Suppose, Client has a e-commerce bussiness, now client use Salesforce Comerce Cloud for their e-commerce site. So, customers select the products and place their orders through e-commerce platform.
Now, Client also using SFDC for their Order management. So, after placing orders, end of the day one batch runs in SFCC ( Salesforce commerce cloud ), which sync with SFDC for all the orders placed in SFCC.

So, when placing an Order in SFCC, customers have an option to collect their order from the nearest store. So, when they reach out to their nearest store to collect the order there in 
store, one store person sitting in front of their system, and from this point actually PasswordLessLogin concept comes, 

Let me explain it with the technical implementaion wise ,
First, in SFDC we provide a public community url. So, we will have a two profile user
1. Community guest user profile ( this is created by default with community )
2. Customer community User Profile ( this is the profile of the customer, who created an account before/after purchase the product from e-commerce site )

So, we created one visualfroce page for example: AuthenticationPage, and this page access is given to guest user profile.
We create another visualfore page for example: PhotoVerificationPage, and this page access is given to Customer Community User profile only.

Now. if for example, the public community url is https://testsalesforececommerceindia.my.site.com/salesforce  then the actual url will be like this below
https://testsalesforececommerceindia.my.site.com/salesforce/AuthenticationPage

so, when store person will open this url, then it will ask for sending a OTP using UserManagement.initPasswordlessLogin(Id userId, Auth.VerificationMethod method)
once otp send, store person will enter the OTP and verify using UserManagement.verifyPasswordlessLogin(Id userId, Auth.VerificationMethod method, String identifier, String code, String startUrl)

In this way , verification will be successfull, and Salesforce will create a new login session of Customer community User/ customer, and will redirect to the following page url - 
https://testsalesforececommerceindia.my.site.com/salesforce/PhotoVerificationPage using Auth.VerificationResult redirect properties.

IMPORTANT: make sure , in public community --> Administration --> members profile section , Customer community User Profile must be added
